      "1.0 üü¢ Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of Hamas,:March towards the border! Think outside the box! Spread out the equations!The resistance has begun its strategic and thunderous strikes, and it still controls the pace of this battle despite the occupier's brutality, indiscriminate killings, and deliberate striking of homes.These crimes, which the world is also witnessing, reflect once again the nature of this Nazi enemy, this fascist monster, where many of our martyrs, hundreds of them, are children, women, and elderly.This aggression extends to the West Bank, and today there is a massacre in the Nour Shams camp, and then it extends to southern Lebanon, where martyrs from our Lebanese brothers and from our Palestinian people rise, in order to break the will of this people and this resistance.We are following the political movements of the United States and some European officials and their visits to the zionist entity, aiming to continue providing psychological and moral support to this cowardly army and this collapsed society after the strategic blow delivered by the Al-Qassam Brigades with the beginning of the Al-Aqsa flood.It has become clear to all observers, and to us from the start, that the US administration has failed miserably, first in providing international and regional support for the aggression on Gaza, and secondly, in influencing the official Arab position to accept displacement.This Arab position is based on our position as the Palestinian people, clinging to our land and homeland, rejecting displacement and an alternative homeland.We commend this Arab and Islamic position, especially that of Egypt, because of the talk about the people of Gaza wanting to move to Egypt, and later the people of the West Bank wanting to move to Jordan.I call for supporting this position and urge embracing it and remaining steadfast, as we see the breaking of this wave related to the malicious displacement plan.The United States of America has failed to neutralize the arenas and fronts, and we see continuous heating and escalation on the borders of northern Palestine, which confirms that the continuation of aggression and the violation of the blood of our steadfast people in Gaza will explode all the equations and plans, whether at the Palestinian or regional level.We warned everyone that this battle could turn into a regional battle if this aggression, brutality, killing, destruction, and violation of the blood of our people in Gaza continues.The United States of America has failed to continue promoting the ‚Äúisraeli‚Äù narratives, lies, deception, and no longer do all these ‚Äúisraeli‚Äù and American narratives deceive anyone in all countries of the world and the free people.\n",
      "1.0 üî¥ Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine:A call for the continuation and expansion of the clash and the continuation of popular mobilizations throughout the West Bank.The Popular Front praises the heroic \"Itamar\" operation and affirms its timely and appropriate execution.The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine praises the heroic shooting operation near the \"Itamar\" settlement north of the occupied West Bank at dawn today, which resulted in serious injuries to two settlers, confirming that it was carried out at the right time and place.Despite the wide and ongoing aggression, continuous incursions by the occupation soldiers, killings, and arrests, and the strict siege on the cities, villages, and camps of the West Bank, the Front embodies its support and backing of the valiant resistance in the Gaza Strip, which proves again that it is strong and capable of dealing painful strikes to the zionist soldiers and settlers, despite the checkpoints, significant zionist security precautions, and high state of alert.The Front calls upon resistance groups and forces to expand the range of fire and open clashes with the enemy along the geography of the West Bank, to create a permanent preoccupation for the enemy, distracting and depleting them, and in response to the ongoing crimes against our people in the West Bank and Al-Quds.The Front urges the necessity of continuing the momentum of popular support and permanent mass mobilization throughout the regions of the West Bank, which must correspond with the scale of the ongoing genocide in the brave Gaza Strip, and the continuous crimes against our people in the West Bank and Al-Quds, as well as the practices against the prisoner movement, emphasizing that the continuation and expansion of the massive and angry popular movement in the West Bank is an influential and pressing matter on the zionist enemy, bringing an important turn in the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood.The Front also calls upon our people to make tomorrow, Friday, a day of open clashing with the zionist enemy and the settlers at all contact points, and to move from mosques and churches, especially in Al-Quds, to the main engagement squares with the occupation.The Front reiterates the importance of continuing mobilizations of Arab peoples and the free people of the world, raising their voice loudly to stop the aggression, the ongoing zionist holocaust, and the genocide that is being waged against our people, especially against children, women, and the elderly.The Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineCentral Media Department9-11-2023\n",

The criminal enemy will once again realize that its crimes will not pass without a response, and the resistance will continue with all strength, determination, and firmness.It is indeed a jihad of victory or martyrdom.Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement - West BankTuesday, 18 Jumada Al-Akhir 1445 AH corresponding to 2/1/2024\n",

It is the fruit of the heroism of the victorious Al-Qassam Brigades and our brave resistance. It is a step on the path to our decision in emptying the prisons and liberating all our free male prisoners and our noble female prisoners.- The blood, pain, and suffering that affected our people in the Gaza Strip affected our people everywhere. Our blood is one and our pain is one, as well and our joy is one with the release of our prisoners, from women and children whose chants for the resistance and its commander-in-chief, the fighting brother Mohammad Deif, are a true expression of the mass support for the resistance, and a popular referendum on our people's choice of the resistance project as a path to liberate the land and the sanctities.üîª Al-Aqsa Flood inflicted a strategic defeat on the occupation, psychologically, militarily, and intelligence-wise, and our victorious Brigades and all our resistance factions will remain the protective shield and the defender of our people until the chapters of this defeat are completed by expelling the occupation and aggression, soon by Allah's will.üîª We affirm our commitment to implementing and making the agreement successful, sponsored by Qatar and Egypt, appreciatively and thankfully, as long as the enemy is committed to implementing it.\n",
