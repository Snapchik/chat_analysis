# Chats exporting and manupulating

So far I've concluded that there is no tool to automate telegram chat extraction and NLP manipulations with them. Like summarization, search, sentiment analysis, bias and dictionary revision.

In this project I would like to check out different techniques ranging from simple Naive Bayes, TF-IDF to using different types of transformers for tasks listed above.

My mission to be as precise and unbiased as I can be.
